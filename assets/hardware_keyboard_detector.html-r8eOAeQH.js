It will not listen for events from any on-screen (software) keyboards.</p><p>This component can be placed anywhere in the component tree. For example, it can be attached to the root level of the Game class, or to the player being controlled. Multiple HardwareKeyboardDetector components can coexist within the same game, and they all will receive the key events.</p><p>The component provides the onKeyEvent event handler, which can either be overridden or passed as a parameter in the constructor. This event handler fires whenever the user presses or releases any key on a keyboard, and also when a key is being held.</p><p>The stream of key events will be normalized by Flutter, meaning that for every KeyDownEvent there will always be the corresponding KeyUpEvent, possibly with some KeyRepeatEvents in the middle. Depending on the platform, some of these events may be “synthesized”, i.e. created by the framework artificially in order to preserve the correct event sequence. See Flutter’s HardwareKeyboard for more details.</p><p>Similar normalization guarantee exists when this component is added to or removed from the component tree. If the user was holding any keys when the HardwareKeyboardDetector was mounted, then artificial KeyDownEvents will be fired; if the user was holding keys when this component was removed, then KeyUpEvents will be synthesized.</p><p>Use pauseKeyEvents property to temporarily halt/resume the delivery of onKeyEvents. The events will also stop being delivered when the component is removed from the component tree.</p><h2 id="constructors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#constructors"><span>Constructors</span></a></h2><p>HardwareKeyboardDetector({void Function(KeyEvent)? onKeyEvent})</p><h2 id="properties" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#properties"><span>Properties</span></a></h2><p>physicalKeysPressed → <code>List&lt;PhysicalKeyboardKey&gt;</code> The list of keys that are currently being pressed on the keyboard (or a keyboard-like device).
